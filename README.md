# Autonomous Lane Detection Project 🚗

## Description
This project implements an **Autonomous Lane Detection system** with:  

- **lane_full_ui.py**: A Streamlit-based interactive UI for lane detection using YOLO and regression-based lane estimation.  
- **accuracy.py**: A Streamlit dashboard to compute lane detection accuracy on the **TuSimple dataset**.  

The UI supports night mode enhancement, optional YOLO object detection, and saving processed images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:

bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas streamlit ultralytics pillow
(If you want, you can create a requirements.txt with these packages for easy installation.)

##TuSimple Dataset

This project uses the TuSimple Lane Detection Dataset
 for evaluating lane detection accuracy.

Download the dataset from the official link.

Use the JSON annotation files for accuracy.py.

Place images in a folder and provide the path in the accuracy dashboard for visualization.

## How to Run

1️⃣ Lane Detection UI
streamlit run lane_full_ui.py


Features:

Upload an image and (optionally) a TuSimple JSON annotation.

Night mode enhancement for low-light images.

YOLO object detection overlay.

Lane deviation alert with customizable threshold.

Save processed images to results/ folder.

2️⃣ Accuracy Dashboard
streamlit run accuracy.py


Features:

Upload TuSimple annotation JSON file.

Computes lane regression for each frame.

Calculates average lane accuracy.

Visualizes accuracy across frames with a line chart.

Optional: provide image directory path to visualize sample frames.

Notes

Make sure image paths match the dataset structure if using accuracy.py.

The repo does not include the full TuSimple dataset due to size constraints.

Small results generated by lane_full_ui.py can be saved locally.
